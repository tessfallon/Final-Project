	<p>Classes I am taking this semester:</p>
	<p>Introduction to Programming, Principles of Economics, Life Writings in Tibetan Buddhism,
	Physics 1602, and Art of Engineering</p>
	<p>My favorite class this semester was Life Writings in Tibetan Buddhism. As a STEM kid,
	it was a nice reprieve from science. Also, it was super interesting and I feel like 
	I learned so much about cultures I knew nothing about before.</p>
